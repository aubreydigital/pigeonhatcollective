Tierney is a Vegas-born musician, lyricist who also dabbles in booking & promoting, mostly by making crafts with Mari. She named her solo-project-turned-band Switterbeet due to her propensity to write sad lyrics with catchy beats. Outside of making music, Tierney likes to buy & slowly kill houseplants, hang with her horrible cat, & loiter at karaoke nights.'

    description: 'The energy of a thousand suns emanates from the mind, body, and soul of Kurian. Based in Las Vegas, Kurian is a spirited rapper whose art serves as a medium for their political outcries. With their affinity for hard-hitting 808s and lush sampling, they craft a soundscape that becomes the perfect vessel for the message they bring across. Originally from the south Indian state of Kerala, Kurian taps into their Marxist roots to deliver a blend of conscious bars with grooving instrumentals. Channeling artists such as JPEGMAFIA and Freddie Gibbs, Kurian takes their alternative edge and tempers it with the heat of the Mojave. The result is a fine blend of floaty beats and cutting lyrics intended to leave an impact on any listener.',

Thankfully there was never a shortage of things of do. Whether it was listening to and/or playing music, skateboarding, or designing graphics and coding web sites on her computer. Things hit a rough patch in her senior year of high school. After a near-death car accident her perspective shifted quite a bit.\n\nBy age 22 she was off to the city for good! She spent time living in Nebraska, Colorado, and Indiana, then finally made the 30 hour trek to move with all her belongings in her car to Las Vegas! Nearly five years later she still loves her surroundings and friends but as each day goes by she realizes more everyday that: this is it! It\'s now or never. Life is short. Believe in yourself before its too late.'

She has developed her musical style through her experiences, taking inspiration from everywhere, from weird sounds she has heard or the things people have said to her.\n\n‚ÄúMy sound has taken me a couple of years to develop and understand, it is constantly evolving. When coming up with my beat ideas, I focus on making something I would want to hear and sing along with.‚Äù\n\nOutside of her unique sounds, Ronnie takes pride in the craftiness and controversy of her lyrics. Taking shots at today\‚Äôs society and its standards, Ronnie is not afraid to make call outs, speaking blunt and honesty at all times.\n\n‚ÄúPeople want to feel something more than what they are being given. At some point, mediocrity isn\‚Äôt going to be enough. We need something authentic and raw. I am sick of all the celebs, media, conspiracies, and DRAMA.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI want to give people something drama free, that\‚Äôs grooving and fun.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI am here to make people smile, dance, laugh, and hopefully, even if it\‚Äôs only for a three-minute song, to make their day a little brighter.‚Äù\n\nBest,\n\nRonnie Wylder'
